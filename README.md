Fyber Beta Program
-------------------

> **Warning**: Please talk to your account manager before using any Beta adapter listed here.

Adapters released under the beta program have undergone full internal testing. They have been temporarily released to the beta program because:

* The ad network reporting API has not been fully integrated with the Fyber platform.
* The adapter could not be verified against the ad network's live environment (for example because a live test app could not be set up).
* Live beta testing & monitoring phase with selected developers has not been completed.


Detailed release information for each adapter in the beta stage can be found on the integration guide for the particular ad network. Once an adapter passes all the above criteria, it leaves the beta stage.
